### **Slide 2: IDEA TITLE**
- **Proposed Solution:**
   - Build a software application for predicting and analyzing groundwater levels based on environmental factors such as rainfall, land use, population, and hydrogeology.
   - The app will also fill in data gaps in time-series data and forecast groundwater levels in space and time.

- **Detailed Explanation:**
   - Uses a combination of real-time and historical groundwater data along with environmental factors to predict future groundwater levels.
   - Integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Machine Learning (ML) models to analyze and visualize groundwater levels.
   - User-friendly interface for public access to forecast groundwater levels at any location and time.

- **Innovation and Uniqueness:**
    - Machine Learning for Complex Pattern Recognition: Identifies hidden, non-linear relationships between environmental variables, enabling more accurate predictions.
    - Multivariate Analysis: Handles complex interdependencies between multiple factors like rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and human water usage.

   - Real-time data updating and model retraining for accuracy.
   - Integrating diverse datasets (spatial, temporal) into one unified model.

- **Strategies:**
   - Use imputation techniques to fill missing data.
   - Set up continuous data pipelines for real-time updates.
   - Regular model retraining using new data points.
